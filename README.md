## ðŸš€ Tasks Overview

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Big Data Scalability (PySpark & Dask)
**Objective:**  
Perform analysis on a large dataset using scalable tools like **PySpark** and **Dask**.  

**Highlights:**  
- Synthetic dataset generation (millions of rows).  
- Data transformations, aggregations, joins, and window operations.  
- MLlib Logistic Regression demo in PySpark.  
- Benchmarking PySpark vs Dask runtimes.  

**Deliverable:** `big_data_scalability_demo.py`

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Predictive Analysis (Machine Learning)
**Objective:**  
Build a regression/classification model to predict outcomes based on dataset features.  

**Highlights:**  
- Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling.  
- Feature selection using correlation and feature importance.  
- Models trained: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
- Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  

**Deliverable:** `predictive_analysis.py`  
(Single-block executable code for direct run in notebook/script.)

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Dashboard Development
**Objective:**  
Create an **interactive dashboard** to visualize insights from a dataset.  

**Highlights:**  
- Built using **Dash (Plotly)** for interactivity.  
- Features:  
  - Distribution plots (sales, customer segments).  
  - Time-series trends (sales over time).  
  - KPIs for revenue growth, top-performing categories.  
  - Interactive filters for regions & categories.  

**Deliverable:** `dashboard_app.py`  

**Run Instructions:**  
```bash
python dashboard_app.py
