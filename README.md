**Project Overview:**
This internship project consisted of four tasks, each focusing on a key area of data science and analytics: Big Data Scalability, Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning, Dashboard Development, and Sentiment Analysis using NLP. The aim was to demonstrate practical skills in data processing, model building, visualization, and textual analysis, while maintaining proper code documentation and reproducibility.

**Task 1: Big Data Scalability with PySpark and Dask**

**Objective:**
To demonstrate the ability to handle and analyze large-scale datasets efficiently using distributed computing frameworks.

**Methodology:**
A synthetic dataset with millions of records was generated to simulate real-world scenarios. PySpark and Dask were used as primary tools for distributed processing. In PySpark, operations such as group-by aggregations, joins, and window functions were performed. MLlib’s Logistic Regression was applied to demonstrate scalable machine learning. In Dask, equivalent operations were implemented, and parallelized processing was leveraged to handle large datasets efficiently.

**Results and Insights:**
PySpark proved highly efficient for very large datasets in cluster environments, while Dask was more lightweight and performed well on medium-sized datasets. Runtime benchmarks highlighted the trade-offs between these two frameworks. This task reinforced understanding of scalable data processing and distributed computation.

**Task 2: Predictive Analysis using Machine Learning**

**Objective:**
To build machine learning models capable of predicting outcomes based on structured datasets.

**Methodology:**
The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical values. Feature selection techniques, including correlation analysis and feature importance, were applied to identify significant predictors. Models trained included Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Model evaluation was conducted using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Cross-validation was used to ensure generalizability.

**Results and Insights:**
Random Forest achieved the highest performance on the test dataset, while Logistic Regression served as a simple baseline. XGBoost performed effectively on imbalanced data. This task enhanced skills in end-to-end machine learning workflows, feature selection, and model evaluation.

**Task 3: Dashboard Development**

**Objective:**
To develop an interactive dashboard that provides actionable insights from a dataset.

**Methodology:**
A sales dataset was used, including features such as product category, region, sales amount, and time periods. The dashboard was developed using Plotly Dash, incorporating interactive filters, KPIs, and visualizations. Visualizations included distribution charts, bar graphs, and time-series trends. Callback functions were implemented to allow real-time interaction with data, such as filtering by region or product category.

**Results and Insights:**
The dashboard allowed dynamic exploration of the dataset and highlighted key business insights. For example, it identified underperforming regions and top-selling product categories, enabling strategic decisions. This task strengthened skills in data visualization, dashboard design, and interactive analytics.

**Task 4: Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing**

**Objective:**
To perform sentiment analysis on textual data, such as reviews or social media posts, using NLP techniques.

**Methodology:**
Textual data was preprocessed through lowercasing, removal of punctuation and special characters, tokenization, and stopword elimination. TF-IDF Vectorizer was used to convert text into numerical features suitable for machine learning. A Logistic Regression model was trained on labeled data to classify sentiment as positive or negative. Model evaluation included accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. Key insights were extracted by identifying the most influential words for positive and negative sentiment.

**Results and Insights:**
The model achieved high accuracy and successfully classified sentiment in the sample dataset. Positive words such as “excellent” and “loved” were strongly correlated with positive sentiment, while negative words such as “boring” and “worst” correlated with negative sentiment. This task provided practical experience in NLP preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment modeling.
